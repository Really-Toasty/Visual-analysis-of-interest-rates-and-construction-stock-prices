# Visual-analysis-of-interest-rates-and-construction-stock-prices
Here I visually compare changes to UK interest rates to various companies within the construction supply chain, from material producers to service providers.

The rationale behind this project is that the majority of construction related activity is related to residential and commercial building. According to Grunberg and Francis (2019), in 2016, the largest construction sectors were private housing (£27.2 billion), private commercial (£26.4 billion), private housing repair/maintenance/improvement (£18 billion), and infrastructure (£17.8 billion). Therefore, if interest rates (and thus mortgages) where to increase, we would expect the value of construction firms to fall as demand for their services diminishes.
Taking a sample of construction stocks that operate at various points along the construction industry value chain.

Blue wedges represent construction and infrastructure firms, Yellow for construction materials, and Green for housebuilders.
By comparing their stock performance to changes in interest rates over a period of approximately 36 years, I found that interest rates do have an influence on stock prices at a glance. 
The performance of companies such as Keller Group (KIE.L) indicate that other factors, such as company specifics or broader economic conditions, may have a greater impact on construction stock prices than interest rates alone.
The next step would be to quantitatively isolate what influence interest rates have on construction stocks, perhaps using a model that looks similar to the following:

Stock_Price = β₀ + β₁(Interest_Rate) + β₂(GDP_Growth) + β₃(Inflation) + β₄(Housing_Prices) 
              + β₅(Construction_Costs) + β₆(Market_Index) + β₇(Company_Specific) + ε

Further analysis of what influences construction stock prices will be conducted at a later date.
